## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-name>
```

2. Open the Xcode Project
* Use Xcode â†’ Open Existing Project
* Initialize the server first before Build & Run the app 
* Build & Run the app
* The sidebar will display the files in MyProjectFiles, and the editor & WebView are resizable.

--- 

3. Sandbox Options

Option 1 (Recommended)
* Keep the sandbox enabled (Enable Outgoing Connections (Clients))
* Use the Xcode Terminal to check the container path, e.g.:  
  ~/Library/Containers/com.yourcompany.app/Data/Documents  
* Copy your project files into that container directory  

Option 2
* Disable Sandbox in Xcode
* Use a folder in Documents, e.g., ~/Documents/MyProjectFiles
* Create your project folder there and paste files

4. Optional: Python Live-Reload Server
* [Python Live-Reload Server](https://github.com/x91823903819038219083190/live-reload-development-server)
* Copy the server into your project folder (or container if sandboxed)
* Navigate to the folder in Terminal:
cd <path-to-server>
python3 server.py
* This starts a server at localhost:8080
* WebView in the app will automatically render it
* You can change the URL in ContentView.swift if needed
